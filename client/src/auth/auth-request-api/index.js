/*
    This is our http api for all things auth, which we use to 
    send authorization requests to our back-end API. Note we`re 
    using the Axios library for doing this, which is an easy to 
    use AJAX-based library. We could (and maybe should) use Fetch, 
    which is a native (to browsers) standard, but Axios is easier
    to use when sending JSON back and forth and it`s a Promise-
    based API which helps a lot with asynchronous communication.
